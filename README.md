Minimal interferring Interactive Risk-aware Planning for multimodal and 
time-evolving obstacle behaviour

## Description
Planning safe human-robot interaction is a necessary towards the widespread 
integration of autonomous systems in the society. However, while instinctive 
to humans, socially compliant navigation is still difficult to quantify due 
to the stochasticity in people’s behaviors. Previous approaches have either 
strongly simplified the multimodal and time-varying behaviour of humans, 
applied hardly traceable methods leaking safety guarantees or were simply not 
computationally tractable. Therefore the goal of this work to develop a 
risk-aware planning methodology with especial regards on minimizing the 
interference between human and robot and taking account the real multi-modality
and time-evolving nature of the humans behaviour, based on the Trajectron 
model (Ivanovic 19).
